    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> Born in Vietnam, I moved to the United States when I was 3. I consider myself a jack
            of all trades since I like to dabble in a little bit of everything - from cooking to 
            weightlifting and most importantly Computer Science. My personal interests include 
            fashion, food, travel & experiences. The next adventure is always waiting!

    <h2>Education</h2>
        <p> In my youth, I attended schools in both Santa Ana and Garden Grove Unified School Districts.
            After graduating from La Quinta High School, I continued my higher education at Orange
            Coast Community College where my original major was in Mechanical Engineering. I decided to
            change my major to Computer Science after a fun and interesting Java programming 
            class in my last semester before transferring. I currently attend California State 
            university Fullerton where I am a Computer Science major in my Senior year.

    <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am currently interested in cloud computing and data analytics. I spend a lot of my time on social
            media and streaming services and experience first hand how well the algorithm works in adapting to
            user preferences. I want to learn the behind the scenes of how learning models can begin to predict
            content based on users' interests given analytical data. Creatively, I want to develop my web design
            skills and test the limits of my imagination.
