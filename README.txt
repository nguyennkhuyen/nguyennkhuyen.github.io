For my portfolio I wanted to adapt a vintage file explorer theme!

how to run my project:
1. git clone https://github.com/nguyennkhuyen/nguyennkhuyen.github.io.git
2. start index.html

The project can be cloned from my github directory and ran on VSCode which is the platform I used to develop it. Note that 
I also have the Live Server extension to launch a local development server.
After cloning, navigate to the project folder and type in the command 'start index.html' or the name of any html file
you want to run.
Alternatively, with the Live Server extension you can also right click on the html file you want to run and press
'Open with Live Server'.
